# Phonebook-creator

In this Python project, we will build a GUI-based Contact Book using the Tkinter and the messagebox module. It is an advanced level project, and you will learn so many things that you will be able to apply in real life. Letâ€™s get started!ðŸ˜Š

**About Contact Books:**
Do you remember those books where your parents used to store all their contacts, names, phone numbers, addresses, and even where they remember them from? Oh, those paper-y days.

Today, we are going to create the same thing, except this one will be on your computer, with the data corresponding to the data from a database where you will store it.

**About the project:**
The objective of this is to create a GUI based Contact Book. To build this, you will need intermediate understanding of Tkinter library, and only a basic understanding of the messagebox module. You will also need to have knowledge about the SQL commands: SELECT, INSERT, CREATE TABLE and DELETE.

**Project File Structure:**
Here are the steps you will need to execute to build python address book project:

1. Connecting to the database and initializing it.
2. Initializing the GUI window, placing the frames and header label and creating some commonly used variables [of this project].
3. Placing the components in the three frames.
4. Creating the functions for the buttons in the frames.
